### Why did I make it?
I do love design and marketing, and often found that colleagues would go on to pretty<br/>
scummy or heavy advertised sites to compress files, and the results were not even guaranteed.<br/>
So yesterday I choose to learn Rust and Tauri and made this little thingy here, it's really<br/>
simple, hence it was made in like 4 hours or less. Hope you enjoy it, it's free after all.

### What is it?
This is a simple UI for dragging and dropping in files you want to get smaller in size.<br/>
e.g. a PDF is 30MB, but you want it smaller? No problem, drag and drop it into compressh,<br/>
and get out a 2-3MB PDF.<br/>
Now you can drag multiple files into it and it'll be no problem. Just wait for the loading screen<br/>
to disappear and you're files should be ready.<br/>

#### These are the file types you can compress:
>png, jpg, jpeg, webp, mp4, mov, mkv, avi, mp3, aac, wav, flac, pdf

Currently compressh isn't made for mac or linux, but when I'm not too bored or lazy I'll boot up my<br/> 
MAC and compile a .dmg on there too.
