### Why did I make it?
I do love design and marketing, and often found that colleagues would go on to pretty<br/>
scummy or heavily advertised sites to compress files, and the results were not even guaranteed.<br/>
So yesterday I chose to learn Rust and Tauri and made this little thingy here, it's really<br/>
simple, hence it was made in like 4 hours or less. Hope you enjoy it, it's free after all.

### What is it?
This is a simple UI for dragging and dropping in files you want to get smaller.<br/>
e.g., a PDF is 30MB, but you want it smaller? No problem, drag and drop it into compressh,<br/>
and get out a 2-3MB PDF.<br/>
Now you can drag multiple files into it and it'll be no problem. Just wait for the loading screen<br/>
to disappear, and you're files should be ready.<br/>

#### These are the file types you can compress:
>png, jpg, jpeg, webp, mp4, mov, mkv, avi, mp3, aac, wav, flac, pdf

I was in the middle of compiling it for MAC, but then my MAC ran out of power, and I forgot where<br/>
my power cable (USB-C) was to the MAC, so you have to wait for me to get a new power cable,<br/>
and also caring enough about this project to finish the compiling for the MAC. <br/>
(was about 90% done with it).
